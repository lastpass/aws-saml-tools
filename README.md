# lp-aws-saml

This repository contains the LastPass AWS SAML login tool.

If you are using LastPass Enterprise SAML with AWS, then this script eases the
process of using the AWS CLI utility.  It retrieves a SAML assertion from
LastPass and then converts it into credentials for use with `aws`.

## Requirements

You will need python with the Amazon boto3 module and the AWS CLI tool.
The latter may be installed with pip:

```
    # pip install boto3 awscli
```

On recent Mac platforms, you may need to pass --ignore-installed:

```
    # pip install boto3 awscli --ignore-installed
```

You will also need to have integrated AWS with LastPass SAML through the
AWS and LastPass management consoles.  See the SAML setup instructions on the
LastPass AWS configuration page for more information.

## Usage

First you will need to look up the LastPass SAML configuration ID for the AWS
instance you wish to control.  This can be obtained from the generated
Launch URL (which is shown in the last-pass extension if you try to edit the details to that entry): if the launch URL is `https://lastpass.com/saml/launch/cfg/25`
then the configuration ID is `25`.

Then launch the tool to login to lastpass.  You will be prompted for
password and optionally the AWS role to assume:

```
$ ./lp-aws-saml.py --username user@example.com --saml-config-id 25
Password:
A new AWS CLI profile 'user@example.com' has been added.
You may now invoke the aws CLI tool as follows:

    aws --profile user@example.com [...]

This token expires in one hour.
```

Once completed, the `aws` tool may be used to execute commands as that
user by specifying the appropriate profile.

## Config File
You can put a config file in your home dir instead of passing parameters to the script.
Name the file `~/.lp_config` with the following content:
```
[aws]
username = username@example.com
saml_config_id = 12345
profile_name = username@example.com
```

## Session File
A file named `~/.lp_session` stores the lastpass session so a second execution of this script which cookie timeout doesn't require password entry.

## AWS additional configuration
In order for the created aws credentials to be available as environment variables put the following in your `.bashrc` (just replace the generic email with yours and call this AFTER you call the lp-aws-saml.py script:
```
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$(sed -nr "/^\[username@example.com\]/ { :l /^aws_access_key_id[ ]*=/ { s/aws_access_key_id = [ ]*//; p; q;}; n; b l;}" ~/.aws/credentials)
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=$(sed -nr "/^\[username@example.com\]/ { :l /^aws_session_token[ ]*=/ { s/aws_session_token = [ ]*//; p; q;}; n; b l;}" ~/.aws/credentials)
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$(sed -nr "/^\[username@example.com\]/ { :l /^aws_secret_access_key[ ]*=/ { s/aws_secret_access_key = [ ]*//; p; q;}; n; b l;}" ~/.aws/credentials)
export AWS_SECURITY_TOKEN=$AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
```
